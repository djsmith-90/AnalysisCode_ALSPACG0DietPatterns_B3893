## Git repository for ALSPAC G0 RSBB and diet analysis code (B3893)

This repository contains three Stata .do files; one for G0 mother analysis
in pregnancy, another for G0 mother analysis at age 4, and another for
G0 partner/father analysis at age 4.

Each file reads in the raw data, cleans the variables for analysis, and then
conducts three sets of analyses:
 - 1) Associations between RSBB and broad dietary PCAs
 - 2) Associations between RSBB and nutrient intake
 - 3) Associations between RSBB and following recommended nutrient intake
guidelines.
